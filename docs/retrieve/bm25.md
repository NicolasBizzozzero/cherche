# BM25

The BM25 models proposed in Cherche are a direct link to the library [Rank-BM25: A two line search engine](https://github.com/dorianbrown/rank_bm25). The Rank-BM25 library implements the alogrithms of the publication [Improvements to BM25 and Language Models Examined](http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/homepages/andrew/papers/2014-2.pdf).

The Search BM25 models index the document corpus in memory with the `add` method.
